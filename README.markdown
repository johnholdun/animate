# Animate
## Animate your text in a modern style

Include this fashionable javascript on a web page and create a stage. The stage can be anything you like! AS LONG AS it is HTML.

Then eventually, call the good function:

`animate(stage, frames)`

Where `stage` is a Node and `frames` is an array of frames

Each frame is itself an array as well, where the first item is the content of the frame and the second item is that frame's duration

Your animation will repeat unceasingly
